### TODO
Add Surat city and Ahmedabad city constituencies to map. [See here for a drawing](http://www.mapsofindia.com/assemblypolls/gujarat/gujarat-assembly-result.jpg).

### Delimitation
The most recent delimitation of Gujarat assembly constituencies came from the 2002 Delimitation Commission. The boundaries were approved by President Pratibha Patil on 19 February, 2008, and were first used in the 2012 assembly election.

### Water
The Election Commission's shapefiles have a bunch of empty constituencies that map to water on an actual map. In the `gujarat_AC_nowater` files, those constituencies have been removed.
